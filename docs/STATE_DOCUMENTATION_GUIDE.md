# State Documentation System Guide

This guide explains the comprehensive state documentation system created for the Hyena-GLT framework to enable efficient context recovery and knowledge transfer across development sessions.

## üìã System Overview

The state documentation system consists of several interconnected components that work together to maintain project context:

### Core Components

1. **Master State Document** (`PROJECT_STATE.md`)
   - Single source of truth for project state
   - High-level status and architectural overview
   - Development timeline and milestones
   - Quick reference information

2. **Session Notes System** (`session_notes/`)
   - Detailed tracking of individual development sessions
   - Granular progress documentation
   - Decision context and reasoning
   - Issue tracking and resolution

3. **Automated Tools** (`scripts/`)
   - Context recovery script for automated state assessment
   - New session script for startup automation
   - Environment validation and guidance

4. **Documentation Templates** (`docs/`)
   - Standardized session notes template
   - Consistent formatting and structure
   - Comprehensive tracking guidelines

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Starting a New Development Session

```bash
# Option 1: Full automated setup
python scripts/new_session.py

# Option 2: Just context recovery
python scripts/context_recovery.py

# Option 3: Manual approach
# 1. Read PROJECT_STATE.md
# 2. Copy session template
# 3. Run tests to verify system health
```

### During Development

1. **Update session notes** as you work (don't wait until the end)
2. **Track decisions** and reasoning for future reference
3. **Document issues** and their resolutions
4. **Note architectural changes** and their impact

### Ending a Session

1. **Complete session notes** with outcomes and next steps
2. **Update PROJECT_STATE.md** if major milestones achieved
3. **Commit changes** with descriptive messages
4. **Set priorities** for next session

## üîß Tools and Scripts

### Context Recovery Script (`scripts/context_recovery.py`)

**Purpose**: Automatically assess current project state for quick context recovery

**Features**:
- Git status analysis
- Project structure examination
- Version information extraction
- Test configuration validation
- Documentation completeness check
- Dependency status verification
- Development stage detection

**Usage**:
```bash
# Basic context recovery
python scripts/context_recovery.py

# Verbose output with details
python scripts/context_recovery.py --verbose

# Generate detailed JSON report
python scripts/context_recovery.py --full-report
```

### New Session Script (`scripts/new_session.py`)

**Purpose**: Streamline the startup process for new development sessions

**Features**:
- Runs context recovery automatically
- Creates session notes from template
- Validates development environment
- Provides startup guidance and quick commands
- Offers session setup recommendations

**Usage**:
```bash
# Full session setup
python scripts/new_session.py

# Custom session ID
python scripts/new_session.py --session-id 002

# Skip context recovery
python scripts/new_session.py --skip-context-recovery

# Skip session notes creation
python scripts/new_session.py --no-session-notes
```

## üìù Documentation Hierarchy

### 1. Quick Context Recovery
- **PROJECT_STATE.md**: Start here for immediate context
- **Context recovery script**: Automated current state assessment

### 2. Detailed Session Information
- **Session notes**: Granular progress tracking
- **Session template**: Standardized format for consistency

### 3. System Documentation
- **This guide**: Understanding the documentation system
- **Session notes README**: Using the session tracking system

### 4. Reference Information
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history and major changes
- **README.md**: Project overview and getting started
- **docs/**: Comprehensive technical documentation

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Context Recovery
1. **Always start** with PROJECT_STATE.md or context recovery script
2. **Check recent changes** in git log and CHANGELOG.md
3. **Verify environment** before beginning work
4. **Run tests** to ensure system health

### For Session Tracking
1. **Create session notes** at the start of each session
2. **Update continuously** throughout the session
3. **Be specific** with file names, commands, and decisions
4. **Link context** between sessions and overall project state

### For Knowledge Transfer
1. **Update PROJECT_STATE.md** after major milestones
2. **Document architectural decisions** and their reasoning
3. **Maintain consistency** between session notes and master state
4. **Keep tools updated** with project evolution

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start session
python scripts/new_session.py

# 2. Review current state and priorities
# (Check session notes and PROJECT_STATE.md)

# 3. Verify environment
pytest tests/ -v

# 4. Begin development work
# (Update session notes as you progress)

# 5. End session
# (Complete session notes, commit changes, update priorities)
